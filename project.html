  <p class="sectionTag text-big"> <u>The End of Illiteracy Is Here.</u></p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br><br><i>Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

    Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.The Aztecs had schools for the noble youths called Calmecac where they would receive rigorous religious and military training.

  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br><br><i>Education is a process of learning through which we acquire knowledge. It enlightens, empowers, and creates a positive development. Education gives an individual the knowledge and skills to work with virtue. It aids the all-round mental, physical, and intellectual growth and development of an individual.

    There are three distinct types of Education- Formal Education, Non-Formal Education, and Informal Education. Education aims to change the way of one’s thinking. Academic knowledge provides one leaning on a global scale, while Practical knowledge is acquired for life on the whole.
    
    Education is imparted to all, at various research and academic institutions, imparted by teachers, professors, and trainers.These institutions conduct various curricular activities that aid the overall growth and development of students.
